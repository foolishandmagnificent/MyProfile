# MyProfile

## This is the first version of my Bootstrap Profile

You can find the Bootstrap version on : https://github.com/foolishandmagnificent/BootstrapProfile
I had to restart the project as my code shown very well on medium and large screens, but wasn't quite responsive on smaller screens.

Here were the requirements :

* Bootstrap
* Grid layout
* Mobile first
* Bootstrap nav
* Google fonts
* Glyphs (![fontawesome](www.fontawesome.com))
* Github page
* Backgrounds
* User story : you can access my work and blog via the navbar, or simply by scrolling down.
